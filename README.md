Patient Management System
Overview
The Patient Management System (PMS) is a web-based application designed to streamline healthcare operations by managing patient records, appointments, and medical data efficiently. Built primarily with TypeScript, this system aims to provide a robust and user-friendly solution for healthcare providers to organize and access patient information securely.
Features

Patient Records Management: Create, update, and retrieve patient information, including medical history and contact details.
Appointment Scheduling: Schedule, modify, and cancel patient appointments with an intuitive interface.
Secure Data Handling: Implements encryption and access controls to ensure patient data privacy and compliance with regulations.
User Authentication: Role-based access for administrators, doctors, and staff to ensure secure and appropriate access levels.
Reporting: Generate reports on patient data, appointment statistics, and system usage.

Technologies Used

TypeScript: 97.9% (Primary language for front-end and back-end logic)
JavaScript: 1.9% (Additional scripting and utilities)
CSS: 0.2% (Styling for the user interface)
Framework: [Specify framework, e.g., React, Node.js, or others if applicable]
Database: [Specify database, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or others if applicable]
Cloud Infrastructure: AWS (Details to be provided in the architecture diagram)
